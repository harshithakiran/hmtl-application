# hmtl-application
A simple form that takes user input for first name, last name & list of hobbies. On hitting the submit button he should be able to see text ‘Loading …’ below the form, more like mocking a asynchronous call.
In a textarea below the form must show only the first name & last name the user submitted.

[ This project was a code test i recieved which was part of the interview process ]
 
Please don’t write any server side code. On submit just wait with a setTimeout(). Please maintain all the states in a redux store.
